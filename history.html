<h2 class="historyIntro">Centuries ago, two entrepreneurs-to-be each began their separate journey to success.</h2>
	<div class="pageBox">

		<div class="contentL">
			<div class="history brewery"><h2>Brothers' Beginning- 1786</h2><p>In 1786
an Englishman named John Molson founded the Molson Brewery after making the move to
Canada. His business would go on to be a major success and source of Canadian Pride</p></div>
			<div class="history railroad"><h2>Railroad to Success- 1836</h2><p> Almost
a full century later and just south of the border, another Englishman named Augustus
Chesebrough took up leave from Europe to come to North America, this time settling in
Pennsylvania. After doing research around the petroleum discovered in the area he purified the
excess and produced what would eventually become Vaseline, a restorative jelly for damaged
skin. Both businessmen continued to develop successful brands that have come to be
household names hundreds of years later</p></div>
			<div class="history export"><h2>Export's Entry- 1903</h2><p> But what they didn’t count on was that the fate of
their companies would eventually become parallel.
On February 14, 2020 every single person affiliated at the executive level of each company
suddenly and mysteriously disappeared, all replaced the same day by hundreds of individuals,
all without any sort of history or proof of existing prior to that day. This new company was
spearheaded by a somewhat familiar name, but uncannily altered. Mr August Cheesebrow is
now found to be at the head of a new company, a hastily spliced combination of the previously
independent companies.</p></div>
			<div class="history clock"><h2>Counting on Molson- 1950</h2><p>With the unveiling of this odd new company many consumers of the old products questioned the
sudden drastic changes. Shortly after a public outcry began over the loss of the previous
companies the CEO Cheesebrow came out to the public with the reasoning for the merge. As it
turns out, the suspicious activity traces all the way back to the 18th and 19th century, in
Europe. As it turns out, the parents of Molson and Chesebrough had already decided to do a
little ‘content mixing’ of their own and thus August Cheesebrow, initially born under the name
Cheegus Molson-Chesebrough was conceived.</p></div>

		<div class="contentR"><div class="history hospital"><h2>Molson Hospital- 1821</h2><p> Born as a terrible adulterous secret the boy was
hidden away from the public for decades. Feeling pity the parents and a small group of
supportive close friends kept watch over the young boy. After spending so many years hidden
from the sunlight, his body developed a unique sensitivity to sunlight wherein he would dry up
and burn to exposure. When one day his parents arrived with the products of the elder
childrens’ companies, Cheegus (who is a natural scientist similar to his non-bastard older
brothers) discovered a careful solution of both Molson lager and a variant of Vaseline called
Intensive Care- Cocoa Radiant will keep his body protected from the harsh sun</p></div>
		<div class="history bank"><h2>Banking on great Endeavors- 1855</h2><p>As his parents’
friends spent so much time looking after him they had also developed a sensitivity to light. To
their amazement, Cheegus showed them the amazing healing possibilities of the new mixture.
Years went by with Cheegus making secret outings to the surface with his protective jelly-lager
(eventually shortened to jellager). He spent the entirety of his time researching business law. As
he grew older he discovered that his solution not only shielded him from the sun, it also
protected his body from major symptoms of aging!</p></div>
		<div class="history return"><h2>Returning to Sustainability- 1927</h2><p> Upon realizing the potential of his new
product he used the knowledge he collected on the surface to expertly seize claim to both the
Molson and Vaseline companies. In a single day he quickly disposed of all the previous
employees (especially the offspring of his half siblings) and brought in his now ancient following
of jelly-lagered up people to fill in the vacancies. He changes his name to appear eerily similar
to his late half-brother to be officially known as Cheegus Cheesebrow. He confided in the
consumers of the previous products that his new product would make them completely forget
about what they used to purchase in favour of his Jellager. Doubt was quickly erased from the
consumers’ minds as they discovered the restorative qualities of Cheesebrow’s product.
The history of Molson and Vaseline quickly eroded from people’s minds as they relished in the
anti-aging jelly-lager that kept their bodies looking young (or at least, the age they were when
they began using it).</p></div>
		<div class="history canadian"><h2>An icon is born- 1959</h2><p>Just as the two companies blew up in success from a quality product so
too did Cheesebrow’s solution. In a rather sick twist Cheesebrow rebranded his personal
discovery to either honour or ridicule its history with becoming one from two and dubbed his
company Molson. Not wanting to expend any finances on branding to keep focus on production
he asked the remaining Vaseline designers to utilize the Molson name and Vaseline branding to
produce new branding for him.</p></div>
