			<div class="history export"><h2>Export's Entry- 1903</h2><p>Molson Export entered the Canadian market in 1903 as a refreshing, well-balanced golden ale. With ingredients dating back to the

			<div class="history clock"><h2>Counting on Molson- 1950</h2><p>In 1950, Molson installed Quebec's largest functioning clock on their side of the montreal factory.
			Visible from 12km away, the Molson clock is a staple of the Montreal skyline, counting great moments in the city's history for 68 years and counting. Now, the iconic hexagon shape of the clock
			has been integrated into the new Molson branding as a celebration of our heritage.</p></div>
